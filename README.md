# Mohr's Circle Android App 

This is the source for my Mohr's Circle Android app, originally made for fun in 2012. I've learned a lot since then and I'm sure Android dev standards have changed quite a bit, but I don't really intend on further updates or maintenance.

Features:
- 2D Mohr's Circle.
- 3D Mohr's Circle.
- Strain rosette input with any gauge angles.
- Convert between stress and strain, & 2D and 3D.
- Compute principal stresses and principal strains.
- Compute maximum shear stresses and strains.
- Determine the shear modulus (G), bulk modulus (K), and Lame's 1st constant from Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio.
- View tensor properties such as principal directions and von Mises stress.
